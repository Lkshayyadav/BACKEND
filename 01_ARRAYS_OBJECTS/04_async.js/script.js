// ASYNC JS 
// Async JavaScript is a way to handle tasks that take time, like fetching data from a server,
// without blocking the rest of the code from running.

// JavaScript is single-threaded (it runs one line at a time), but with async, 
// we can run long tasks (like API calls or timers) in the background.
